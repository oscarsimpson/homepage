## Hosting

GitHub -> GitHub Pages

## Engine

Using Jekyll to build a static site

## Content

Initially setting it up to have blog posts and a limited selection of main pages

## Theming

Completely custom theming. I didn't like [minima](https://www.github.com/jekyll/minima). Instead I'm taking tips from [jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) but will rapidly deviate. Among other changes I intend to trial SCSS, although I have not attempted any frontend development.
